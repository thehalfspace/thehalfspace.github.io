      <description>I got rid of my old website I created in Jekyll two years ago, primarily because I hadn&amp;rsquo;t updated that in a while and I forgot everything about ruby that I had learned in a couple of days to make that website. After a whole lot of procrastinating, I decided to try the new website in Hugo. I chose a pretty simple theme and I intend to modify it to create something of my own.</description>

      <description>I am taking a course on communicating your science in Winter 2018 and this post is a part of the assignment. I will try to continue writing more stuff like this.
Are we having big earthquakes more often these days compared to the past?
If we look at the data, the answer seems to be yes: a lot of big events happened after the year 2000! Most big earthquakes occur at the interface of continent and ocean boundaries, and therefore are usually followed by a series of tsunamis just as devastating as the earthquakes themselves.</description>
