      <description>I started out as an amateur bedroom guitarist in high school and now I&amp;rsquo;m getting a little more into audio recording and music production, still in the bedroom. Unlike the typical spare bedroom music studio, my bedroom studio is my actual bedroom where I sleep and make music, and also work (during covid).
I am trying to learn Bass, Synth (MIDI), and music production (Ableton) these days.
Here are some of my amateur(ish) incomplete demos (original compositions):</description>

      <description>These are not sponsored. I am just trying to create content for my website.
I am trying to write about the budget home recording setup that I have here. WIP, this may be incomplete if you see it now.
Check out some recordings I did with these setup here.</description>

      <title>Creating this website with Hugo and Github</title>

      <description>So I just finished publishing this website without errors and I thought I would document it here. To my pleasant surprise, It was pretty straightforward.
I followed these steps:
  I followed the first few steps directly from the getting started guide of hugo, where I installed it using brew, created an empty site and initialized it with git.
  Now this second part is really really hard, which involves choosing a theme.</description>

      <description>I am taking a course on communicating your science in Winter 2018 and this post is a part of the assignment. I will try to continue writing more stuff like this.
Are we having big earthquakes more often these days compared to the past?
If we look at the data, the answer seems to be yes: a lot of big events happened after the year 2000! Most big earthquakes occur at the interface of continent and ocean boundaries, and therefore are usually followed by a series of tsunamis just as devastating as the earthquakes themselves.</description>

      <description>I am a PhD student at University of Michigan working with Yihe Huang. My current research is numerical modeling of earthquake cycles for strike-slip fault systems. In simple terms, I am simulating multiple earthquakes over long period of time (~2000 years) for systems like San Andreas Fault. I am interested in understanding how the material and frictional properties of the fault rock influence the earthquake cycles.
I come from Mumbai, India, where I spent most of my childhood.</description>

      <description>Damaged fault zones and seismic cycles I am currently working on understanding the effect of low velocity zones surrounding an active fault on long term fault slip. Such a setting is common in mature faults like San Andreas, California, and Northern Anatolian, Turkey. We use mechanical models with prescribed stresses and friction to solve the elastodynamic equation of motion. The earthquake rupture sequences in the cycle happen spontaneously as a result of self-organized stresses, and is not defined by the user.</description>

      <description>I got rid of my old website I created in Jekyll two years ago, primarily because I forgot everything about ruby that I had learned in a couple of days to make that website. After a whole lot of procrastinating, I decided to try the new website in Hugo. I chose a pretty simple theme and I intend to modify it to create something of my own.
I don&amp;rsquo;t really have a niche so I will talk about everything I can: earthquakes, math, music production and guitar stuff, or tech stuff.</description>
