      <description>So I just finished publishing this website without errors and I thought I would document it here. To my pleasant surprise, It was pretty straightforward.
I followed these steps:
  I followed the first few steps directly from the getting started guide of hugo, where I installed it using brew, created an empty site and initialized it with git.
  Now this second part is really really hard, which involves choosing a theme.</description>

      <description>I got rid of my old website I created in Jekyll two years ago, primarily because I forgot everything about ruby that I had learned in a couple of days to make that website. After a whole lot of procrastinating, I decided to try the new website in Hugo. I chose a pretty simple theme and I intend to modify it to create something of my own.
I don&amp;rsquo;t really have a niche so I will talk about everything I can: earthquakes, math, music production and guitar stuff, or tech stuff.</description>
