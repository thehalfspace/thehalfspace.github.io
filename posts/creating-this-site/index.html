        <p>So I just finished publishing this website without errors and I thought I would document it here. To my pleasant surprise, It was pretty straightforward.</p>
<p>I followed these steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>I followed the first few steps directly from the <a href="https://gohugo.io/getting-started/">getting started guide of hugo</a>, where I installed it using <code>brew</code>, created an empty site and initialized it with <code>git</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Now this second part is really really hard, which involves <a href="https://themes.gohugo.io/">choosing a theme</a>. Later I realized that it is very easy to switch between themes in hugo, so in retrospect, this shouldn&rsquo;t be that hard or time-consuming. I ended up choosing <a href="https://github.com/luizdepra/hugo-coder">hugo-coder</a> which seems to be one of the more popular themes (i.e., more support and functionalities, yay!). <a href="https://github.com/TrentSPalmer/hugo_themes_report">This report</a> from a random reddit post helped me make the decision.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I think the best way to add themes is using submodules (<code>git submodule add &lt;github-url-for-the-theme&gt; themes/&lt;theme-name&gt;</code>) even if the instructions say otherwise. I learned this the hard way but it is very easy to install multiple themes and switch between them using submodules. All the themes are stored in the /themes/ directory and you just need to change one line in the config.toml file.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I created a github repository named <a href="https://github.com/thehalfspace/personal-blog">personal-blog</a> and pushed this site to it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I created another repository on github with the name thehalfspace.github.io (which would be <!-- raw HTML omitted -->.github.io) to host the site. I found this technique pertty interesting where you host the rendered site in a different place (<a href="https://github.com/thehalfspace/thehalfspace.github.io">https://github.com/thehalfspace/thehalfspace.github.io</a>) and the source material in a different place (<a href="https://github.com/thehalfspace/personal-blog)">https://github.com/thehalfspace/personal-blog)</a>. It makes so much sense to do this, but I didn&rsquo;t know of this before. In order to do this, we add the above hosting repository as a submodule to the <code>public/</code> directory. I pretty much followed <a href="https://gohugo.io/hosting-and-deployment/hosting-on-github/">the official instructions</a> for hosting on github which didn&rsquo;t quite worked for me. For some reason, I had to change the step 6 to <code>git submodule add -b master https://github.com/thehalfspace/thehalfspace.github.io public</code>, but surprisingly, the branch name is `main`` when I change directory to public. The <a href="https://github.com/thehalfspace/personal-blog/blob/master/deploy.sh">deploy.sh</a> is pretty cool which I run everytime I want to update stuff, and it automatically renders and pushes the changes to my hosting repository (<a href="https://github.com/thehalfspace/thehalfspace.github.io)">https://github.com/thehalfspace/thehalfspace.github.io)</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Now that my site is up and running, I want to add some extra stuff. I added <a href="https://www.goatcounter.com/">goat counter analytics</a> which is a privacy friendly version of google analytics. Note that when using themes as submodules, you want to make changes to stuff in the <code>/themes/_theme-name_/folder</code> and not in the root of your site. So, in order to add goat analytics, copy the code into <code>/themes/hugo-coder/layouts/partial/analytics.html</code> or whatever your theme name is.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>This is all I have done so far, the next thing I want to do is add a view counter on the home page of the site. Goat analytics gives the script for that, I just need to figure out where to place it. I also need to add comments, disqus is the easiest choice, but I&rsquo;ll have a look at the alternatives before going forward with it. I&rsquo;ll update this section of the post once I have these changes ready. Finally, it would be nice to create and avatar to replace the stock avatar in my home page. I&rsquo;ll write about it in a subsequent post.</p>
<p>Peace,
( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)</p>
